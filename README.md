# Etterna-pad
Fork of [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna) with a few changes to make it more suited for ITG/DDR players

# Features/Tweaks TODOs
**Overlay `ScreenSelectMusic.lua`**
- [ ] Instead of showing "Jumpstream, Handstream, Chordjack" and other keyboard-style patterns, remove that MSD ratings panel and show ITG/DDR patterns like Crossovers, Sideswitches, Brackets, Footswitches, etc... like in ITGMania
- [x] Show patterns from .sm files like in ITGMania (i.e. XO, FS, etc...)

**Other**
- [ ] Implement ITG timings
- [ ] Implement ITG score calculation
  - I think this is kinda hard because of the way MSD rating is implemented in Etterna
- [x] Working background videos _(Only on Windows currently)_
